1. An IDE has the following advantages over a text editor:
  - no need for separate temrinal
  - Syntax Highlighting
  - Debugging capabilities
  - Error checking and code refactoring
  - Extensions for every possible use case available (at least in vs code or pycharm)
  - Version control integration easy

2. Not proven yet, but tested a lot. (Collatz conjecture)

For Integers up to 1M: [collatz.java](collatz.java)


- for class diagramms: no formal requirement for camel case, just stay consistent

6. Software design:
   - “(1) The process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces 
   and other characteristics of a system or component.
   (2) The result of the process in (1)”

7. Software analysis is focusing on understanding the problem and gathering requirements, while design focuses on how to craft a solution for the problem.


8. A software design is needed because:
   - software can become very complex very quick, so development is made easier by breaking software down
   - Makes collaboration easier
   - Makes maintenance easier
   - prevents errors early on

   - If no software design is given, consequences could be unanticipated errors, no maintainability etc.
   For code snippets, toy projects you wouldn't need a software design.


9. They are interdependent - If you for example have a web shop that should display some user information in the user interface it needs to get that from the database.
